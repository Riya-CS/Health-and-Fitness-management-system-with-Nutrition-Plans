### 3. Configure Database Credentials
Before running the application, open the `PythonFiles/db_config.py` file and update the MySQL `user` and `password` fields with your own MySQL username and password. For example:
```python
db_config.py
DB_CONFIG = {
    "host": "localhost",
    "user": "your_mysql_username",
    "password": "your_mysql_password",

}
```
You only need to update your credentials in this one file.

### 4. Run the Application
```cd PythonFiles
python Create_Tables.py  # Run this ONLY ONCE to create the database and tables
python Start_page.py     # Launches the main application```
```
📝 Note:

You only need to run Create_Tables.py once to set up the database schema.

Do not run it again, unless you want to drop existing data.
